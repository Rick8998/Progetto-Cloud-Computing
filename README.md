### It Speaks! Create Synthetic Speech Using Text-to-Speech 

The Text-to-Speech API lets you create audio files of machine-generated, or synthetic, human speech. You provide the content as text or Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML), specify a voice (a unique 'speaker' of a language with a distinctive tone and accent), and configure the output; the Text-to-Speech API returns to you the content that you sent as spoken word, audio data, delivered by the voice that you specified.
